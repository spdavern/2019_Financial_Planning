# Overview

This folder/repo contains work created using R (ver. 3.6.0) and RStudio (ver.
1.2.1335).

The purpose of this work was multi-fold: 

* Extend work done in 2013 and 2018 to model and forecast Seed giving data and create projections for 2018-2019 budgeting purposes.
* Previous work was done using JMP which is not accessible to those without that software, including me now. Transferring this work into R allows sharing with others and my own re-use. 
* Iâ€™m using this exercise to document my own R/RStudio skills and to create examples.
