# Overview

This folder/repo contains work created using R (ver. 3.6.0) and RStudio (ver.
1.2.1335).

The purpose of this work was multi-fold: 

* Extend work done in 2013 and 2018 to model and forecast Seed giving data and create projections for 2018-2019 budgeting purposes.
* Previous work was done using JMP which is not accessible to those without that software, including me now. Transferring this work into R allows sharing with others and my own re-use. 
* Iâ€™m using this exercise to document my own R/RStudio skills and to create examples.  I am experimenting with a blend of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) and coding-like project organization suggested by pavopax.[^1]

This project uses [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and  [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) for package dependency management.

# R Notebooks  {#nb}

[Link to this README file](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/spdavern/2019_Financial_Planning/blob/master/README.html) which renders the equations in the table below properly.

|--------|---------------------------|
|README|This R Notebook that summarizes the contents of the project and that produces the github flavored MarkDown making GitHub easier to consume.|
|Transfer of 2013 Analysis|Convertion of modeling done in 2013 into R. Uses the model: $\textit{Monthly Giving} = a+b_{year}+c_{month}$|
|2018 Model Extensions|Applies the 2013 model to giving data through part of 2018|
|Months Giving Per Week Model|Models monthly giving per week per giver data from 2010 to 2018 using the model: $$
ln{\left[\frac{\textit{Monthly Giving}}
{\textit{Number of Sundays in Month}*\textit{Giving Families}}\right]} 
= a+b_{year}+c_{month} + \epsilon
$$|
